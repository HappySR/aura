# Aura: Adaptive Unified Resilience and Alerts

A Modular Multi-Disaster Alert and Management System.

## Objective

A modular, scalable, and deeply functional disaster alert system that prioritizes usability, reliability, and preparedness. Each disaster type operates as a self-contained module, enabling detailed management and future expansion without compromising system integrity. Initially designed and tested for the ByteHacks hackathon.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Comprehensive Coverage, Not Overcrowding**

   - Deep, focused implementation for each disaster module.
   - Purposeful feature development based on necessity.
   - Quality over quantity approach.

2. **Scalability and Modularity**

   - Organic system growth capability.
   - Independent disaster modules.
   - Non-disruptive feature additions.

3. **Practical User Empowerment**

   - Actionable insights over technical complexity.
   - Comprehensive guidance and resources.
   - Full disaster cycle support (pre, during, post).

4. **Location-Aware Intelligence**

   - User location-specific alerts.
   - Risk profile customization.
   - Dynamic real-time recommendations.

5. **Preparedness Focus**

   - Proactive user education.
   - Risk mitigation strategies.
   - Interactive preparedness drills.

6. **Privacy Protection**
   - Optional account creation.
   - Minimal data collection policy.
   - Value-added account features:
     - Custom preferences.
     - Alert zone configuration.
     - Disaster reporting capabilities.
